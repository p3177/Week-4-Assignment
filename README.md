## Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment

This repository is created to share following files created towards assignment of week 4 in Getting and Cleaning Data course.

1. r_analysis.r : This file contains R script required to convert a raw (messy) data set into tidy data set.

2. Codebook.md : This file explains how to interpret tidy data set.

3. TidyDataSet.txt: This file contains tidy data set created using r_analysis.r

4. README.md: This file explains everything about the repository.



When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
